#### A CPS-based Scheme Interpreter in Scala

My aim with this project is to implement an Interpreter for a decent subset of Scheme in Scala. 
This project is still in its beginning stages.


The next points to do:

* implement a basic recursive evaluator
* add primitive operations
* add support for macros
* convert to continuation passing style to support tail call optimization


Maybe later:

* oop support
* implement a compiler
