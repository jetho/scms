#### A CPS-based Scheme Interpreter in Scala

My aim with this project is to implement an Interpreter for a big subset of Scheme in Scala. 
This project is still in the beginning stages and currently only provides a Parser and an Environment abstraction.

The next points to do:

* implement a basic recursive evaluator
* add primitive operations
* add support for macros
* convert to continuation passing style for supporting tail recursion

Maybe:

* add oop support
* implement a compiler
